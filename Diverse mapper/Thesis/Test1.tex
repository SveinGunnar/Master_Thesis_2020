\subsection{The Code}
The code start in the main function by creating two thread that launch their own function. The first function are running a while loop that are multiplying two matrixes together and uses the result in the next iteration of the loop. 

The second function transfer the data that are generated in the first function
from DRAM to NVM. Then it will analyze the data that have been generated. This process will repeat itself every time the first function have generated data.

The function are being synchronized by using the openMP functions omp\_set\_lock and omp\_unset\_lock. When the first function have finished generating data in one
